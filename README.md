# useful class-room phrases

useful css class-room phrases is a small selection for css classes used inside content areas.
To have some self-explanatory and self-describable classes you can use writng text and reading.
Instead of writing ```style="float:right;margin:0 5px 0 5px;"``` every time.

Its only useful **not-general elements**, not for general templating.

Its a little bit against sense of CSS, but not so much against it than others;)

In addition to [Eric Meyer reset-css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

Just copy these classes to your css and remove what you don't want

Do you have improvements, just write me or pullrequest.
This version is english, like css. But I think of language translations.

## special

* **ul**: has no list-style but a bullet image
* **panel**: is for middled fixed width websites
* **row2**: to have a not html-tabled 2-column table with an definiton list. This class is above the dl if you use not changable markup like markdown etc
* **depot**: parking depot for htmlsnippets moved and used by JS like 'thank you' messages. On load these are not displayed, but appear with some JS interaction

### not usefeful

**Not** class-room phrases are if you put paddings and margins.....?

## overwrite

I think its ok to change this few values and not to overwrite them. But you could *mark* changed parts with break in new lines

Original
``` css
img.left { float:left;margin:0 5px 5px 0;}
```

Changed
``` css
img.left { float:left;
margin:0 11px 11px 0;
}
```


## payload
Is an set if base64 icons. Please dont use the whole list, but just copy&paste single icons.

Also nice [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) and use sprites.
